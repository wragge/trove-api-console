#Trove API Console

A simple console for exploring the [Trove API](http://help.nla.gov.au/trove/building-with-trove/api).

See it in action at: http://troveconsole.herokuapp.com

To run your own version you need to get yourself a Trove API key and set it as the value of TROVE_API_KEY in an environment variable. See the [Heroku docs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-local) for information on setting this up.
