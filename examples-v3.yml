            note: Adding `reclevel=full` adds a number of additional fields to the article metadata, the actual fields added depends on the category. In newspapers and gazettes it adds  `illustrated`, `wordCount`, `correctionCount`, `tagCount`, `commentCount`, `listCount`, `trovePageUrl`, and `pdf` (which is a link to a PDF of the whole page on which the article is published). In works it adds `tagCount`, `commentCount`, and `listCount`.

                  value: newspaper
                  value_note: you can only harvest from one category at a time, so this must be set to a single category such as 'newspaper'

                  param_note: setting this to 'true' ensures that results will stay in the same order when you request subsequent pages; without it results might be duplicated or missing

                  value: '*'
                  value_note: use '*' for the first request, then replace with the value of `nextStart` for subsequent results
            note: "Three parameters are important when harvesting a complete result set: `category` must be set to a single category, `bulkHarvest` set to 'true', and `s` must be updated after each request with the value of `nextStart`. Note that the `nextStart` value will only appear if there is another page of results to download, so you can use it in your loop as a check to see if you've finished."

            note: This parameter can be used multiple times, however, this will behave like an `AND` query and only those articles in *all* of the specified categories will be returned. So adding `&l-category=Article&l-category=Advertising` will return *zero* results, as no articles are in *both* the 'Article' and 'Advertising' categories.

            note: This parameter can be used multiple times. Unlike the `category` facet, this will behave like an `OR` query, returning articles published in *any* of the specified places. So adding `&l-state=Victoria&l-state=ACT` will return articles published in *either* Victoria or the ACT.

            note: You can use the `format` index in both the query and as a facet, that means you can say that you *don't* want works with particular formats. This is handy for filtering out noise.

            note: The way that versions are grouped as works in Trove can be quite confusing. The work level metadata is generally quite consistent, but it can leave out useful metadata that's attached to an individual version. The version metadata is richer, but is also less consistent, so you have to be prepared for some trial and error if you want to extract information from it.

            note: The `fullTextInd` index seems quite misleading as it includes articles from commercial databases where only a truncated sample of the full text is actually available, and electronic legal deposit works where access to the text is restricted. It would seem better to combine this indicator with a search for "nla.obj" or `nuc:ANL:DL` to try and limit to resources digitised by the NLA and partners.

            url: 'https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/result?q=weather&category=magazine&encoding=json&l-title=The bulletin'
            note: There's no controlled list of journal titles to use with this facet, so you probably need to get the values from the web interface.

            note: An alternative to using the `title` facet is to include the identifier of the parent journal in the `q` parameter. This is how the [Trove Digitised Journals](https://trove-titles.herokuapp.com/) app works.

            url: 'https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/result?q=rights:Free&category=image&encoding=json&include=workversions'
            note: This facet only works with records where the copyright status is specified in the record. Some out-of-copyright photographs might be missing from results because their status has not been identified. A search for photos created before 1955 using `date[* TO 1954]` might find additional out-of-copyright images.
            params:
                - param: q

                  value: workversions
                  value_note: the rights statements are attached to versions, so to see them you need to ask for the full versions data
    - heading: Get facets
      section_note: Facets break the result set into sections and can provide a useful overview. Note that there are limits on the number of facets returned, so they might not include the whole result set.
      examples:
          - heading: Facet results by decade
            url: 'https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/result?category=all&facet=decade&n=0&encoding=json'

    - heading: Get individual records
      section_note: Article or work identifiers are supplied as part of the url rather than as a query parameter. For example, `https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/41697877` returns the details of the article with the identifier `41697877`.
      examples:
          - heading: Get a newspaper or gazette article
            url: 'https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/41697877?encoding=json&reclevel=full&include=articletext,tags,comments'

            url: 'https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/list/43805?encoding=json&reclevel=full&include=listitems'
            note: You only get the brief record version for each of the list items, so to get extra information, such as OCRd text for a newspaper article, you'll have to request each article individually. Also, the list items are not paginated, so if you have a long list this will return a lot of data.

      section_note: There's a bug in the API so that a request for newspaper titles also returns the gazette titles. See the GLAM Workbench for [a workaround](https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-newspapers/#get-a-list-of-trove-newspapers-that-doesnt-include-government-gazettes).
